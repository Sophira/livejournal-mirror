Hey [name]!

WHAT IS THIS?

NEWS:
=====

* NEW WINDOWS CLIENT

  The new LiveJournal for Windows client has been put
  up on the preview releases page:

     http://www.livejournal.com/download/preview/

  There have been a ton of cool changes, both in new
  features and fixed bugs.  I'll give free paid-accounts
  to the first 5 people to report unique critical bugs 
  in the client (as opposed to lack of features).

  If you're curious what the new client can do, read:

* CONTEST

  The LiveJournal style/theme contest has been extended
  another few days until July 27th because so few people
  had submitted entries.  If you or somebody you know
  has a really cool looking LiveJournal, tell them to
  go register, because at this point nearly everybody
  who enters will win something.

* BANNER ADS

  Yes, there are now banner ads on LiveJournal, but
  not on people's journals, only at the bottom of the
  main LiveJournal information pages.  However,
  there are ads in the message boards, unless you're
  a paid user.  That's about the only benefit to
  sending in money at this point (to have them disabled)
  but there are more paid-user features coming in
  the upcoming weeks.  (if you don't pay, don't worry...
  there are still tons of new things coming for you.
  In fact, there will probably never be a substantially
  larger number of paid-user features.  Getting a
  paid-account is just a way to show your support.)

* NEW SERVER

  Thought LiveJournal has been fast lately?  It has.
  I've been tuning the database and my code non-stop
  getting it to behave.  Well, in the middle of it all
  when I thought I wasn't going to get it fast enough,
  I decided to upgrade the server.  The machine is
  currently a single Pentium II 400 Mhz with 384 MB
  of memory.  The new machine which I just obtained
  today is a dual-Pentium III 550 w/ 512 MB of memory.
  The dual processors along with the code improvements
  should solve LiveJournal performance problems for
  quite some time.  I'll build the new system starting
  Monday and do the switch from the old server to the
  new one late at night on Thursday or so.  The switch
  should be quick.
