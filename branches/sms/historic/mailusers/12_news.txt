NEWS:
=====

* NEW PR PERSON!

  I'd like to welcome Chris Morrow (user: gigglecam)
  to the LiveJournal team!  She's going to be doing
  LiveJournal PR, and helping me out with the business
  aspects of the site.

* MOOD ICONS

  Last week or so you were able to start setting your
  current mood and music.  This week you're now able to
  select what sort of icons (if any) you want next to
  your moods.

  You can see a list of moods and all the icons at:

     http://www.livejournal.com/moodlist.bml

  To set which type show up on your journal, go to:

     http://www.livejournal.com/modify.bml

  If you think all the choices are terrible and you
  can make better ones, let me know!  Ideally I'd like
  to see 10 sets or so, to give everybody some good
  choices.  Also, if there are any moods I forgot,
  let me know and I'll add them.  Of course, you can
  always just type in whatever mood you want, but
  these are the ones that can have pictures.

* HELP LIVEJOURNAL!

  If you're feeling helpful, check out the list of
  things I need help with:

     http://www.livejournal.com/help.bml

  That list is just a start --- I'll be adding to it
  a lot from now on.
