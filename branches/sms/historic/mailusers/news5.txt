Hey [name]!

WHAT IS THIS?
=============
You are getting this because at some point you opted to receive LiveJournal news.  Read below for how to unsubscribe.  However, please don't unsubscribe... I rarely send out updates, so when I do they're usually somewhat interesting.  (well, okay, I *try* to make them interesting)

NEWS:
=====

* NEW SERVER IS UP!

  The days of LiveJournal being slower than a turd may now
  be over ... the new server is setup and configured 
  wonderfully.  All it took was a few days of not sleeping.
  I've had it running for the past few hours and it seems
  to be doing quite well.  The better news (which is not
  obvious to users) is that everything in LiveJournal is now
  served/logged via the database, so it should be just
  a 10 minute job to add more servers in the future, and
  have them all share the load.

  If you encounter ANY problems over the next few days,
  do tell me ... I'll get on it and fix it.

* REDESIGN..S!

  Okay, some different LiveJournal designs are available now,
  with more coming.  The default look will be selected later
  by a vote.  But for now, you can select your preferred
  scheme by going to one of the following URLs:

    http://www.livejournal.com/?setscheme=classic
    http://www.livejournal.com/?setscheme=lynx
    http://www.livejournal.com/?setscheme=bluewhite
    http://www.livejournal.com/?setscheme=opalcat

  That sets a cookie to remember your favorite scheme.
  To remove the cookie and go back to the default scheme, go

* STYLE/COLOR CONTEST!!

  This is a sneak announcement which I plan to make in a few
  days --- LiveJournal will be holding a style & color theme
  contest in a bit here.  Users will be able to submit custom
  styles and color themes they've created and a panel of judges
  will rank them.  There will be prizes for all types of
  applications, but complete styles (lastn+calendar+day+friends)
  will have the biggest prizes, with color themes having
  the smallest.  But perhaps best, I'll give tons of credit and
  public recognition to all users that submit entries.

  Offical rules and deadlines and all that will be up on the
  web within a few days, but here are some base rules if you
  want to get started already:

     * styles must be entirely free of the %%color-*%% tags, or
       must only use them entirely.  there will be two sets
       of style entries: fixed color or variable color.  i'm
       sure fixed-color ones will look fancier, but the biggest
       prizes will go to variable color ones (where users can
       select their colors)

     * there can be no hard-coded names or whatnot in the style,
       it must be usable by any user.  (that's the point of
       this contest, to get you guys to do the web design because
       i suck at it ... if you don't want your work being made
       public, don't enter the contest)

     * styles should be able to use most/any color themes well.

     * color themes should be able to work on any/all styles well.

  I'll also be making a frames-based preview tool, where you can
  enter a username, style (from drop-down), theme (from drop-down),
  and press "View" and it'll show up in the bottom frame.  This
  will assist both you and the judges.

* SLEEP.

  I think that's it.  I'm going to bed.  It's 5:23 am.
