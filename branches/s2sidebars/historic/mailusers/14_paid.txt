Hey [name]!

WHAT IS THIS?
=============
You are getting this because you have a paid account at LiveJournal.com.

NEWS:
=====
I just wanted to write to say that your paid account months are now
counting down.  Previously I was just crediting them up, waiting until
I felt that paid accounts were finally valuable.

So, you have a paid account until:

    [paiduntil]

For a list of features that you now have, or soon will have, see:

I thank you once again for getting a paid account.  You may have noticed
the server is bogged down during certain parts of the day lately.  This
will all change soon enough.  I'm going to be getting a lot of new servers.
Follow the news at http://news.livejournal.com/ for what I'm planning.

If you want to help, try and get your friends to get paid accounts too, or
at least make them aware of the URL above, so they can make the decision
on their own.  The price is set low enough that nobody should have a problem
with the money.  The biggest annoyance for most is just doing it.

Thanks!
