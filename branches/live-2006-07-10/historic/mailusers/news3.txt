Hey [name]!

WHAT IS THIS?
=============
You are getting this because at some point you opted to receive LiveJournal news.  Read below for how to unsubscribe.  However, please don't unsubscribe... I rarely send out updates, so when I do they're usually somewhat interesting.

NEWS:
=====
Well, I'm now done with classes for the year.  Only two days of finals remain, and then I'll be working on LiveJournal a ton during the summer!  Here are some new features you should expect sometime in the next week or so:

* PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS

  At times, LiveJournal has been responding pretty slowly lately.
  I have an extra server just about ready to go and am going to
  hook that up when I'm done with finals.  That should roughly
  double (if not more, because of people reloading if it's slow)
  the speed of the site.  I'll also be improving a lot of the
  database setup to be faster.  So, please bear with me if
  LiveJournal is slow the next few days... it'll get better
  really soon now.

* NICER ADDRESSES

  You can now access your journal with an address like this:

     http://bradfitz.livejournal.com/

  Neat, eh?  Thanks to user 'evan' for this idea.

* NEW WINDOWS CLIENT ... SOON!

  The new upcoming Windows client just plain rocks... that's 
  about all there is to say.  Changes include:

  - You'll be able to add subjects to your journal entries.  This
    is extremely important to people who run news sites using
    LiveJournal.  As an example, I made a LiveJournal theme that
    makes your friends view look exactly like Slashdot.org.  :)
    The web client and the Linux client already have this.  The
    subject support in the Windows client is complete, but it 
    can't be released until the buggy parts of the new version
    are fixed.

  - Security settings:  you can pick who can read what journal
    entries.  You'll be able to do this from the web too,
    once the windows client is released.  (Trying to keep it in
    sync).

  - Spell checking!  Thanks to David Beroff (user: d4b) for
    donating the entire $169 to buy the license for the spell
    checking component.  The next version of LiveJournal will
    have a spell checker built-in, so you can spell-check by
    hitting F7 or automatically before you post (an option).
    I'd also like to thank the other users that sent in money
    for this cause... minki & scottbarlow.  I seem to be
    forgetting somebody else, though.  Let me know!  I'll use
    the extra money to pay a web designer (I suck at HTML) to
    make some cool public styles for LiveJournal.

* CURRENT MOOD/MUSIC SUPPORT

  After all the above stuff, I'm going to be adding "current
  mood" and "current music" support.  Or, more generally:
  "current <xxxxx>".  Current music will be obtained from
  WinAmp or XMMS/mpeg123/etc, or you can enter it yourself.
  Current mood support will be from the client, or from your
  imood.com mood.  We're going to be working with imood.com
  to integrate the two services a little.  Current "weather"
  could be obtained from different weather websites...
  the possibilities are endless... :)

* MULTI-PICTURE SUPPORT

  LiveJournal will let you have multiple pictures in a bit,
  and you'll be able to pick which to use for your journal
  entries.  (one will be your default).  This'll work with
  current mood support to let you choose different pictures
  for different moods.  (I'd like to thank user 'faith' for
  this idea... I really like it)

And so much more... I have so many new ideas for LiveJournal, 
so I'll have plenty to do this summer.
