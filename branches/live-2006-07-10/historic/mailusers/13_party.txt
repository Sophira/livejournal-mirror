Hey [name]!

You may or may not be signed up to get LiveJournal news, but I'm emailing all people in the Northwest that have updated their journal recently.  Why?  Because you should come to the LiveJournal party, that's why!

Read about it here:

In summary, here's the info:

What: LiveJournal BBQ/Potlock Party.
When: 4:00pm Saturday, September 9th, 2000 until 1-3am Sunday morning.
Activities: Volleyball/Frisbee/Tennis in the park near the house, then food, then back to the house at night for movies/darts/socializing.
Where: 5251 16th Ave NE, Seattle, Washington
Parking: ... sucks. Carpool if possible. Park on the street in the 2-hour parking areas (which is free on the weekends) or park a few blocks away and walk.

If you need a ride, there are a bunch of people driving from all over the place, so talk to somebody that's replied to the original post and see if they can pick you up.

If you need to crash at my place that night, bring a sleeping bag or something.
