Hey [name]!

WHAT IS THIS?
=============
You are getting this because at some point you opted to receive LiveJournal news.  Read below for how to unsubscribe.  However, please don't unsubscribe... I rarely send out updates, so when I do they're usually somewhat interesting.

NEWS:
=====

* SERVER PROBLEMS

  By now, I'm sure you've noticed that the LiveJournal server
  is getting pretty slow at times.  I've been making tons of
  optimizations that help out, but not enough to compete
  with the insane number of new users that join every day.
  However, don't worry --- I have an extra server ready to
  turn on and help manage the load (now that all the LiveJournal
  code is ready for multiple servers) but I'm waiting for
  my web hosting company (Virtualis.com) to upgrade the
  operating system before I start using it.  They're being
  extremely slow.  I'm almost tempted to give you all the
  names and phone numbers of contacts I have there so you can
  help me bug them, but I'm not so sure how much that would
  help.

* REDESIGN

  I've redesigned the main site.  Why?  Because the old
  one was hard to navigate around.  But for those that hate
  the new design, don't worry --- it's being redesigned again
  by somebody that doesn't suck at making things pretty.

* NEW WINDOWS CLIENT

  The new Windows client has been out for awhile at:

  But I don't have an install program for it yet.  I'm still
  fighting with InstallShield trying to figure it out.

  This version is a lot nicer than 1.2.5, but still doesn't
  have spell-check support.  I have spell-check support working
  in my local copy, but because of the extra components and
  dictionary files, I really need to learn InstallShield before
  I can release it, otherwise manual installation is a pain.

* TONS OF LITTLE THINGS

  I've been working on tons of little things ... you can now
  delete posts in message boards.  You can ban specific users 
  from posting in your message boards.  You can now export
  your entire journal to save on your computer for backups,
  etc, etc.... I forget everything.

* SUGGESTIONS?

  Got any cool things I could work on?  (besides fixing the
  damn servers... that's my main priority)
