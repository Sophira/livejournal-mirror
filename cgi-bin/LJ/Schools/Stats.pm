LJ::Schools::Stats: LJ::Schools::Log entries statistics.

For efficiency, the table here contains four fields:

 * day, stored as a UNIX epoch time for the midnight of that day
 * userid of the user who touched the directory;
   lack of userid indicates that this row reflects activity of all volunteers
   on a given day
 * action that that user has taken;
   lack of action indicates that this row reflects all actions volunteer(s)
   have taken on a given day
 * count of log entries corresponding to that day, userid, and action

Please note that LJ::Schools::Log is up to decide whether to count the given
action in statistics; its insert functions have the "nostats" parameter that
disables passing data to here.

$LJ::DISABLED{'schools-logs'} disables this module from functioning. After that,
it writes data to /dev/null and pretends that all tables are empty when reading.

# LJ::Schools::Stats->query: generate a report about touches in the given
# time interval
#
# Signature: LJ::Schools::Stats->query(%args)
#
# For each call, it inserts or updates four rows, namely:
#
# %args must include the following:
#
#  * mintime: the lower bound of the time interval
#  * maxtime: the higher bound of the time interval
#  * group: type of report (types are explained below)
#
# Let me note one more time that "mintime" and "maxtime" are mandatory; making
# them optional would make it less efficient.
#
# There is also an optional "userid" argument that makes "day" and "day-action"
# reports filter touches by the passed user.
#
# Types of Reports:
#  * userid: return all users who touched the directory and how many touches
#    they performed.
#  * day: return all days in the given interval, indicating how many touches
#    were performed.
#  * userid-day: for each user and day, return the number of touches
#  * userid-action: for each user and action type, return the number of touches
#  * day-action: for each user and day, return the number of touches
#
# The sub returns an arrayref containing hashrefs with table rows, so it's up
# to the calling side how to parse these data.
