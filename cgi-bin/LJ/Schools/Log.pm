LJ::Schools::Log: a logger module for Schools Directory actions

It logs pretty much what is passed to it: school data before the change, school
data after the change, timestamp for the change, and who performed it.

It can also log when a state or a city is renamed by doing complex-but-efficient
INSERT SELECT queries. Some notes on efficiency are available in the sub that
performs these queries.

Unless it is specifically said not to do so, this module passes data to
LJ::Schools::Stats for synchronous statistics collection.

$LJ::DISABLED{'schools-logs'} disables this module from functioning. After that,
it writes data to /dev/null and pretends that all tables are empty when reading.

# LJ::Schools::Log->log_mass_action: add several rows corresponding to a mass
# action performed on the Schools directory; "mass action" here can mean
# renaming a city or renaming a state.
#
# signature:
# LJ::Schools::Log->log_mass_action(%hash);
#
# in the hash, the "movetype" key indicates which of the mass actions is
# performed:
#
#  * "city" corresponds to renaming a city; in this case, hash must contain
#    "country", "state", "city1", and "city2" keys
#  * "state" corresponds to renaming a state; in this case, hash must contain
#    "country", "state1", and "state2" keys
#
# regardless of the movetype, there are two optional hash keys that are
# interpreted as well:
# userid: initiator of the change. LJ::get_remote() if unspecified.
# nostats: do not send information to stats
#
# Note that for each call to this function, only one touch is reported to
# Stats, provided that "nostats" is not enabled.
#
# Regarding the SQL queries, they are supposed to be efficient, though to be
# honest, I didn't test it. They are most likely more efficient than selecting
# and then looping over results, but seriously, I didn't aim for them working
# in a nanosecond. Mass actions like these aren't performed too often, so
# $remote can wait another second or two until logging is completed as well.
#
# (Also, Mark Smith used similar queries in LJ::Schools without hesitation, so
# I only added comparably complex queries in here. :P)
#
# Regarding the logic, "ahh, SQL". The select here works on the schools table
# left-joined with itself. t1 here is the school that is being changed by the
# move, and for a given t1, it tries to find t2, a school in the target
# city/state that has exactly the same name. If that school exists, it's a
# merge; otherwise, it's a move.
