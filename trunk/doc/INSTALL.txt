Installing LiveJournal should be extremely simple.  If it's not, then
we consider it a bug and you should report it.  Email
bradfitz@livejournal.com with any questions or errors you find in this
document.

This short document was getting very stale, so now it's just a pointer
to the complete and up-to-date docs:

In the future, we'll try to get the relevant install sections of the
manual converted to text format for inclusion here.
