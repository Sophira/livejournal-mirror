      Styles are the part of LiveJournal that allows users to customize the look of their accounts.

    <para>
      Currently there are two types of style interfaces available to use,
      the older <quote>S1</quote> which is very linear and dumb, and the newer
      <quote>S2</quote> which features its own sort of programming language.
      A draft comparison of both systems can be found at <ulink url="http://www.livejournal.com/dev/s2/goals.bml" />
