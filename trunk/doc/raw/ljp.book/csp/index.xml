  <title>Client/Server Protocol</title>
  <partintro>
    <para>
      This client/server protocol is the aspect of LiveJournal that makes it a little more unique than other journal systems.
    </para>
    <para>
      Currently there are two types of interfaces available to the LiveJournal protocol, the older "flat" interface, or the XML-RPC interface.
      The XMLRPC interface is probably easiest to use, because there are quite a few XML-RPC resources available to developers in just about any programming language.
      If you're in a situation that requires you to write your own interface wrapper, then the flat interface is probably best to use.
    </para>
    <note>
      <para>
        Internally, both interfaces are just wrappers around the same APIs.  Don't worry too much about which one you use, as they accomplish the same thing.
