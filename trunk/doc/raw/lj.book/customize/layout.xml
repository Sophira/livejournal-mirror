  <title>Creating a New <abbrev>BML</abbrev> Scheme</title>

    The look of your site is probably the first thing you're going to want 
    to customize, because c'mon, who wants a LiveJournal.com clone?

      You'll want to look at the BML section in ljp docs that details writing
      a local <filename>bmlp.cfg</filename> file, which you can use to specify
      certain directives.
      <!-- FIXME: write that section; clean up this text -->
      To start, you're going to want to create a directory under the local cvs
      bml scheme directory (<filename class="directory">/cvs/local/cgi-bin/bml/scheme/</filename>).
      The name of this directory will be the unique identifier for the template
      you're creating, which you will use later for testing purposes.
