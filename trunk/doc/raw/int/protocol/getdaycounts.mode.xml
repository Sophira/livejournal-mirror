For each day that the user has posted a journal entry, a key in the form yyyy-mm-dd  is returned, with the value being the number of entries posted that day. The absence of a key implies zero entries for that day, as well as the presence of a key with the value "0". Note that mm and dd are always two digits, zero padded, so the total key length will always be 10 characters.
