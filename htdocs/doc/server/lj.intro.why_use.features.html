      &#8220;out of the box&#8221;, including but not limited to:</p><div class="variablelist"><p class="title"><b>Journal related</b></p><dl><dt><span class="term">Journaling service</span></dt><dd>LiveJournal's core function. Users are able to submit journal
            entries and &quot;publish&quot; them on their account's journal page.</dd><dt><span class="term">Community journals</span></dt><dd>Journals that many users can post top-level entries to. This allows
            for more long-term and public discussion than comments in a user's journal.</dd><dt><span class="term">Friends list aggregation</span></dt><dd>Users are able to add other users to their &#8216;friends list&#8217;, which
            permits them to view all journal entries from their friends in an aggregate form.</dd><dt><span class="term">Friends filters</span></dt><dd>Users can view a subset of their friends lists at any given time.</dd><dt><span class="term">Calendar view</span></dt><dd>Users can see a record of all of their posts in the past, and
            choose to view those posts by a specific day (allowing easy access to old posts).</dd><dt><span class="term">Message boards</span></dt><dd>Users can enable or disable message boards for individual
            entries or journals as a whole. Users can choose to allow anyone,
            registered users only, or friends only to post. Users can choose to
            &#8216;screen&#8217; comments &#8212; make them visible only to the owner of the journal &#8212;
            and choose to set certain levels of comments to be automatically screened
            until approved (such as a user who may choose to screen all comments by
            non-friends until they are approved).</dd><dt><span class="term">Email notification of comments</span></dt><dd>Users can choose to receive an email
            notification when someone comments on one of their posts (in the user's
            personal journal or in a community journal) or replies to one of their
            comments (in the user's personal journal, a friend's journal, or a
            community journal).</dd><dt><span class="term">Security levels</span></dt><dd>Users can specify who can read their journal entries.
            Entries can be public (all can read), private (only the user can read),
            protected (only the user's named &quot;friends&quot; can read), or custom. Custom
            security allows a user to specify up to 30 subgroups of their friends who
            can read the entries.</dd><dt><span class="term">RSS feeds</span></dt><dd>Your installation publishes all public journal content as a RSS feed for
            syndication on other sites. LiveJournal allows users to syndicate external RSS
            feeds onto LiveJournal, to read on users' Friends page. (Adding RSS feeds to user's
            friends list needs &quot;syndication points&quot;, and each feed costs a certain
            number of points based on how many users are watching the feed).</dd><dt><span class="term">Moods, </span><span class="term">mood icons</span></dt><dd>Each entry can be given a &#8216;mood&#8217;, to
            describe what the user is feeling at that time. Users can choose to add a
            &#8216;mood icon&#8217;, which is a small picture to depict that mood. Users can
            create their own &#8216;mood icon&#8217; themes for use in their journal.</dd><dt><span class="term">Polls</span></dt><dd>Users can create different types of polls, to get opinions,
            information, or thoughts from readers.</dd><dt><span class="term">User picture icons</span></dt><dd>The ability to upload small &quot;avatars&quot; that
            represent the user throughout the site.</dd><dt><span class="term">Personalized subdomain</span></dt><dd>If configured, users can view their journals at
            http://username.<i><tt>domain</tt></i>.com, as well as
            http://www.<i><tt>domain</tt></i>.com/users/username and
            http://www.<i><tt>domain</tt></i>.com/~username.</dd><dt><span class="term">Customizing the display of the journal page</span></dt><dd>Users can create journal &quot;styles&quot; from scratch and have
            precise control over appearance of their journals.</dd><dt><span class="term">Friends of Friends feature</span></dt><dd>Users are able to see a list of entries by
            the users who are named as a friend by their friends, but not by
            the user.</dd><dt><span class="term">Downloaded clients</span></dt><dd>Users can download a program to make journal entries
            (and perform some other actions on the site) from their computer, rather
            than from the website.</dd><dt><span class="term">Tell a Friend</span></dt><dd>With one click on the &#8216;read entry&#8217; page, users can send an
            email to someone else about an entry, calling the recipient's attention to
            it.</dd><dt><span class="term">Export feature</span></dt><dd>Users can download their journal month-by-month, in XML or
            CSV format.</dd><dt><span class="term">meme tracking</span></dt><dd>Users can view a list of URLs that have been most
            referenced in journal entries site-wide. Users can also check to see where
            those URLs are being referenced. (By some slight alteration, users can
            also see if anyone on your installation is linking to a specific URL, and where.)</dd><dt><span class="term">Random feature</span></dt><dd>Users can view a random journal from a subset of users who
            have updated in the past 24 hours.</dd></dl></div><div class="variablelist"><p class="title"><b>Account related</b></p><dl><dt><span class="term">User bio</span></dt><dd>Users can provide information about themselves, which is
            displayed on a page that can be viewed by visitors to their journal (the
            &#8216;user bio&#8217;). Users can specify contact and location information (email,
            AIM username, Yahoo! ID, ICQ #, MSN Messenger username, Jabber address,
            city, state, country, etc) and specify the security level of that
            information (public, private, protected)</dd><dt><span class="term">Site search</span></dt><dd>Users can search by contact information &#8212; finding other
            users by email address, AIM username, Yahoo ID, ICQ #, MSN Messenger
            username, Jabber address, etc &#8212; to locate people on your installation.</dd><dt><span class="term">Interests</span></dt><dd>Users can list up to 150 one to four-word interests in their
            user bio, which other users can search for.</dd><dt><span class="term">Similar interest search</span></dt><dd>Users can see a list of those users whose
            interests match most closely to their own, based on an index that weights
            both number of interests in common and rarity of interests in common.</dd><dt><span class="term">Popular with friends search</span></dt><dd>The ability to see a list of the users who
            are named most often as a friend by the user's friends, but not by the
            user.</dd><dt><span class="term">Domain forwarding</span></dt><dd>Users can forward their domain to their LiveJournal (so that, for example, http://journal.example.com would
            forward to the user's LiveJournal at http://www.<i><tt>domain</tt></i>.com/users/username)</dd><dt><span class="term">Journal embedding</span></dt><dd>Users can &#8216;embed&#8217; their journal into their home pages,
            displaying their journal as part of an external home page. (This is
            different from domain forwarding; with domain forwarding, the content is
            served from the LiveJournal installation; with embedding, the content is first pulled
            onto the user's server and then re-presented.)</dd><dt><span class="term">Text messaging</span></dt><dd>Users can specify their text message information and
            display an option on their user bio page to allow others to text message
            them. (This allows users to receive text messages without having to make
            their information public.)</dd><dt><span class="term">Memory list</span></dt><dd>Users can name any post on the service as a &#8216;memory&#8217; &#8212; a LiveJournal
            version of bookmarking. Memories can be categorized with different
            keywords, so that users can more easily sort their memories.</dd><dt><span class="term">To-do list</span></dt><dd>Users can create their own &#8216;to-do&#8217; list &#8212; reminders or
            important things to do &#8212; and track percentage complete and progress on
            each item.</dd><dt><span class="term">Birthday list</span></dt><dd></dd></dl></div><div class="variablelist"><p class="title"><b>Site related</b></p><dl><dt><span class="term">Directory</span></dt><dd>Users have access to the directory of users, where they
            can search by location, age, interest, etc.</dd><dt><span class="term">Portal</span></dt><dd>Users can use a more complex update page, which includes &quot;boxes&quot;
            of several other features, such as statistics and birthdays, on the same
            page as the update page.</dd></dl></div></div><div class="navfooter"><hr><table width="100%" summary="Navigation footer"><tr><td width="40%" align="left"><a accesskey="p" href="lj.intro.why_use.html">Prev</a> </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="u" href="lj.intro.why_use.html">Up</a></td><td width="40%" align="right"> <a accesskey="n" href="lj.intro.goat.html">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td width="40%" align="left" valign="top">Chapter 3. Why Use LiveJournal? </td><td width="20%" align="center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.html">Home</a></td><td width="40%" align="right" valign="top"> Chapter 4. Frank the Goat</td></tr></table></div></body></html>
