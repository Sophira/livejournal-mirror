Hey [name]!

WHAT IS THIS?
=============
You are getting this for one of two reasons... 1) you opted to receive LiveJournal news.  Read below for how to unsubscribe.  However, please don't unsubscribe... I rarely send out updates, so when I do they're usually somewhat interesting.  (well, okay, I *try* to make them interesting), 2) you have a custom LiveJournal style, so I thought you'd be interested in hearing about the contest.

NEWS:
=====

* BACK FROM VACATION

  I'm back from "vacation" (visiting relatives), so I'll
  be working on LiveJournal again.  Couldn't find a fast
  Internet connection in Iowa.  The phone lines could only
  do 28.8k ... even 56k was out of the question.

* CONTEST!

  The LiveJournal style/theme contest has been underway for
  awhile now, but the entry form is now online.

     http://www.livejournal.com/contest/

  Go submit your styles and themes!

* TO-DO LIST ONLINE

  My to-do list has made it off my PalmPilot and onto the
  website, for those that are curious.  I'll try to keep it
  updated and detailed:
