Hey [name]!

WHAT IS THIS?
=============
You are getting this because at some point you opted to receive LiveJournal news.  Read below for how to unsubscribe.  However, please don't unsubscribe... I rarely send out updates, so when I do they're usually somewhat interesting.

NEWS:
=====
The main news for this newsletter is that there are TONS of new features being worked on or coming very soon.  I'll briefly summarize them below:

* LOGIN SUPPORT (completed)

  You can now "login" to FreeVote and you won't ever have to type
  your username and password at the website anymore.  You can 
  choose to login until you close your browser (best for public 
  computers) or forever (best on your own computer).  Of course, 
  you can logout anytime.

* SECURITY

  In a few days you'll be able to set the security level on each
  one of your posts.  The default will be "public" like it is now,
  but you'll also have the following options:

      "private" -- only you can read it
      "friends" -- only your friends can read it
      "custom"  -- you can pick what groups of your friends
                   can read it

  For a friend to read protected stuff in your journal, they'll
  have to be logged in.  Login/Logout links will soon appear
  on journals.  (You'll be able to hide them if you want.)
  This will be in LiveJournal 1.2.6 for Windows.  The web
  update stuff will lag behind a little bit.

* SUBJECTS/HEADLINES

  A lot of people have requested the ability to add subjects
  (like headlines, for news posts) to their journal entries.
  The database and unreleased beta client now support this,
  but I have to modify the style system to show the subjects.
  This will be in LiveJournal 1.2.6 for Windows, and on
  the web update page when it's ready.

* SPELL CHECKING

  A lot of people have also requested spell checking to be
  added to the Windows client.  I looked into it, and I think
  the best way is to buy a commercial spell-checking component
  that I'll be able to plug into LiveJournal.  It's royalty-
  free and easily redistributable, but it costs a one-time
  fee of $169.  If I made money off of LiveJournal I would pay
  for this, and I almost am tempted to buy it myself, but I
  just can't justify it.  A few people have volunteered to
  help pay for it.  If you want to pitch in $10-$20 or so, let
  me know.  I'll give you credit in the application and on
  the website for bringing spell checking to LiveJournal.


That's about all I can think of now.  I need to go do homework 
now.... grrrr.  :/
