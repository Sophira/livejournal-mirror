Subject: LiveJournal Notice, part 3 (sorry)

[name] ...

Sorry again ... this should be the last message for awhile.  In the future, check:

  http://www.livejournal.com/news.bml

Or, sign up for the LiveJournal newsletter, which usually comes out about once a week.

All I wanted to announce in this notice is that the prices I posted previously were quite high.  I thought about it, did some math, and I have a new price:

   $25/year, or $15/6 months

That's half what I said before.

This will *only* be to remove banner ads from journals, not to use LiveJournal.  A few people mailed me saying, "Oh, you're charging for LJ now ... guess I can't use it anymore."  *sigh* No, I'm just charging for the ad-free version. 

Also, I'm continuing to make progress on the server, so please have patience.  Thanks!
