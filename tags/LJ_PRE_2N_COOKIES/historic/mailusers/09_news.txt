Hey [name]!

WHAT IS THIS?
=============
You are getting this for one of two reasons... 1) you opted to receive LiveJournal news.  Read below for how to unsubscribe.  However, please don't unsubscribe... I rarely send out updates, so when I do they're usually somewhat interesting.  (well, okay, I *try* to make them interesting), 2) you have a custom LiveJournal style, so I thought you'd be interested in hearing about the contest.

NEWS:
=====

* SERVER DOING WELL

  After days of tweaking, the new server is up and running
  and doing pretty well.  The last two days have been
  pretty smooth, so I'm announcing this now.  The days
  immediately after the upgrade sucked, so my apologies
  to those of you that had trouble logging in.

* CONTEST!

  If you're comfortable with the LiveJournal style system
  and want to make some public styles (or color themes),
  the first ever LiveJournal contest is now running:

     http://www.livejournal.com/contest/

* NEW SITE LOOK

  Thanks to user "opalcat", the LiveJournal site now looks
  really nice!  I'm glad to finally replace my horrid
  HTML.

* NEW FEATURES

  I've added a few new features the past couple days:

    -- you can now go back and forward pages in
       your most recent and friends views

    -- you can enter a short biography in the
       "edit personal information" area and it'll
       display on your user info page.

    -- LiveJournal can now ftp (or scp) your
       journal to your own website when you update.
       This feature is new and not 100% complete.
       Let me know if you're interested in it.

    -- Style system has been updated to fix a lot
       of previously retarded things:  links to
       sections of your journal were changing your
       domain name (username.livejournal.com to www.*)
       Also, only one year of your history is displayed
       now in the calendar to save download speed.
       You can flip between the years with links.

* COMING NEXT...

  A sneak peak at things to come:

    -- you'l be able to see a list of interests and check
       all that apply to you.  then....

    -- there will be a search engine that'll let you find
       users based on:  geographic location, update time,
       gender, age, interests, email address, name...

    -- customizable comments pages (still working out
       details on this...)

    -- oh so much more.
