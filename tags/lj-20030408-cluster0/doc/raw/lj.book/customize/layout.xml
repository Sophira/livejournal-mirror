  <title>Creating a New <abbrev>BML</abbrev> Scheme</title>
  <para>
    The look of your site is probably the first thing you're going to want 
    to customize, because c'mon, who wants a LiveJournal.com clone?
  </para>
  <section id="lj.customize.layout.config">
    <title><filename>bmlp-local.cfg</filename></title>
    <para>
      You'll want to create a new <filename class="config">cgi-bin/bmlp-local.cfg</filename>
      file in your <filename class="directory">cvs/local</filename> directory.


      To start your scheme, you're going to want to create a folder under the
      bml scheme directory (<filename class="directory">/cvs/local/cgi-bin/bml/scheme/</filename>).
      The name of this folder will be the unique identifier for the template
      you're creating, which you will use later for testing purposes.

    <title><abbrev>BML</abbrev> Blocks to Worry About</title>
    <para>
      In <abbrev>BML</abbrev>, global blocks are defined in the file
      <filename>cgi-bin/bml/scheme/global.look</filename>. Global blocks are simply 
      initial template definitions, which other schemes look up to fall back on when their
      own local template hasn't been defined.
