  <title>Setting Site-Specific Hooks</title>
  <para>
    The LiveJournal code provides a number of hooks, which you can use to
    alter or extend the functionality of the code, tailored for your own site.
    You're free to implement as few or as many as you want.
    <note><para>
      If there's a hook you want but don't see, let us know and we'll be more
      than happy to add it in.

    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      One of the reasons for implementing hooks on LiveJournal came from a 
      need to make distinctions between account status types, without leaving
      a lot of kludge in the code base, and without having to write extensive
      code libraries in the ljcom <abbrev>CVS</abbrev> repository.
