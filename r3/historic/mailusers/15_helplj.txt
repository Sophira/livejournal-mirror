Subject: LiveJournal News -- Please help!

Hello,

Please excuse this unwanted email.  LiveJournal's in a little bit 
of trouble right now.

The problem is that it's getting too popular.  That's not normally a problem,
but it is when the server can't handle the 16,201 people and their friends
trying to use it.  Have you noticed how slow LiveJournal's site is lately?
Pretty pathetic.  I've been doing all I can to optimize the code, but you
can only do that for so long.  At a certain point you really need to upgrade
the machines.

To be honest, I need about $10,000 to buy new servers.  (nice servers, 
at that... which'll last awhile)  The problem is, I don't really have
$10,000 lying around.

Here's the good news though --- you, [name], can buy a
paid account for $25 and help LiveJournal out.  If you and 399 other
people do this, all is well.  If not, well ... I'm not sure what'll
happen.  Maybe I shut it down to new subscribers, severely restrict
what non-paid members can do, and focus on school for a change.
I'd *really* hate to do that... school sucks.  Plus, LiveJournal's
more fun when a lot of your friends are also using it, and although
you may pay, it's unlikely all of your friends will.

Although the current revenue stream from LiveJournal is sufficient
to maintain the current servers and even the future servers, I still
need that $10,000 to buy the new machines.

Please, if you can spare $25, please get an account... it'd really
help.  For more information, including the added benefits of having
a paid account, visit:

Thanks for reading this far.  Again, my apologies for the spam.  :)
