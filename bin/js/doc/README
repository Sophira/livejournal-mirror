To generate documentation you will need some java VM:
sudo yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk

We do not want to explode documentation with bad docs from files
that are not ready for jsdoc, so we explicitly define the list
of files that will get into docs is defined in file docs_source.txt
If files belong to repository different than livejournal add a suffix
and create another file, e.g.:  docs_source_ljcom.txt and commit it to
that repository.

To generate docs simply run gendoc.sh script from any location.
Ready docs will be availible at $LJ_ROOT/jsdocs/
