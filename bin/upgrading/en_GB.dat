<?p Welcome to the LiveJournal Support Volunteer Area! p?>
<?p Most LiveJournal Support requests are handled on a public board, and these requests can be answered by any registered user. However, unlike some informal support forums, LiveJournal uses a screening process to ensure that the answers that reach users follow certain guidelines. When you first start answering requests in Support, your answers will be screened, and you won't be able to see other screened answers. Experienced Support volunteers will approve the first answer that fully answers the request and follows Support's guidelines. p?> 
<?p While volunteers needn't understand every aspect of support before beginning to answer requests, it's best to have a general familiarity with the basic guidelines required by LiveJournal Support: p?> 
<ul><li>Be professional and courteous.</li> <li>Don't copy other people's answers.</li> <li>Don't contact people outside the Support board to discuss their request or give them information.</li> <li>Keep information in Support requests private.</li></ul> 
<?p All of the guidelines in place exist to best serve our users. Often, volunteers feel frustrated when they know the correct answer to a user's request, but do not understand all of the details of answer writing. Many resources exist to assist new volunteers in overcoming the frustrations. All of these resources are jointly maintained by LiveJournal employees and experienced Support volunteers. Some of the resources you may find most helpful include: p?> 
<ul><li><a href="/doc/guide/support.bml">The Support Guide</a></li> <li><?ljcomm lj_support ljcomm?></li> <li><?ljcomm helpscreening ljcomm?></li></ul> 
<?p Additionally, many LiveJournal volunteers enjoy interacting socially with other volunteers. The official LiveJournal community for the social side of LiveJournal Support is <?ljcomm supportlounge ljcomm?>. p?> 
<?p When you are ready to try your hand at answer writing, you can find open tickets on the <a href="/support/help.bml">Support board</a>. p?> 
<?p Thank you for your interest in LiveJournal Support. Volunteers like you help keep LiveJournal running smoothly! p?>
