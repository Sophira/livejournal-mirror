/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.options.header=Journal entry options

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.options.mood.example=happy

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.options.music.example=The Pixies: Where is my mind?

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.options.tags.example=greyhounds, potato, wool

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.options.text=Most journal specific features can be set via "lj-headers" in the body of your message. The lj-headers should be at the top of your message, separated by a newline. All lj-headers are completely optional, and simply override your journal defaults.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.options.userpic.example=userpic keywords

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.security.friends.desc=The post can only be viewed by those on your Friends list.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.security.group.desc=This is literally the name of a friend group. Only friends belonging to that group can view the post.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.security.group.example=Example: [[header]] <b>my friends</b>

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.security.public.desc=The post is posted publicly.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.headers.security.text=Security options are set via the lj-header "[[header]]". If the security type specified is unknown, the journal entry defaults to private. If no security is specified, the entry is posted according to your default journal security.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.gallery.example=vacation photos

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.gallery.header=Choosing a gallery

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.gallery.text=You can specify what photo gallery you want your attachments uploaded into using the [[header]] header.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.header=Image attachments

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.layout.header=Changing image layout

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.layout.text1=If you attach multiple images, you can change the way they appear in your journal via the [[header]] header.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.ljcut.header=lj-cut behavior

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.ljcut.text=By default, images [[ljcutsize]] or smaller are placed in your journal without an <a [[aopts]]>lj-cut</a>. You can change this behavior using the [[header]] header. Valid options are "[[count]]" and "[[titles]]". Using "[[count]]", if you attached 3 images in your email message, the lj-cut would read, "( 3 images )". Setting the [[header]] header to "[[titles]]" changes the cut caption to the title of the filename, one cut per image. "( emo.jpg ) ( pict002.jpg ) ( me_and_bob.jpg )"

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.security.header=Image security

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.security.text1=Images are publicly viewable by default. Use the [[header]] header to change this behavior. Please note that image security is separate from your journal entry security! For example, you can have a journal entry that is private, while the pictures within it are public. This feature only changes the security on the images themselves - not the journal entry.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.security.text2=Valid options are "[[option1]]", "[[option2]]", and "[[option3]]".

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.size.header=Changing the image display size

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.size.text1=You may attach images of any size. They will be displayed in your journal at a maximum size of [[maxsize]]. The default size is [[defaultsize]]. You may specify a size using the [[header]] header. Images larger than [[ljcutsize]] will be automatically placed behind an <a [[aopts]]>lj-cut</a>.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.size.text2=Valid sizes are "[[size1]]", "[[size2]]", and "[[size3]]".

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.images.text=If you have <a [[aopts1]]>[[scrapbook]]</a> access (and enough disk quota), any image you attach to your email message will be automatically uploaded to your [[scrapbook]] account and displayed in your journal entry. All images above [[dimensions]] in size are displayed under an <a [[aopts2]]>lj-cut</a>. Using <a [[aopts3]]>lj-headers</a>, you can change the way the images look in your journal, as well as set various image attributes.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.optionalfeatures.posttocommunity.header=Posting to a community

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.subject_images=Subject: Neat, I can post pictures via email.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.text1=Email posting uses normal email messages to post to your journal or a community. Your PIN needs to be embedded in the email address, subject, or body of the message. Embed your PIN by prefixing it with the [[plus]] symbol. You must be sending the message from an email address on your "Allowed sender addresses" list. If you embed your PIN in either the subject or the body, it will be automatically removed before posting.

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.text2=Posting via email permits many options to be set on a per message basis. Because of this complexity, we've separated examples into different topics. Please select from the list below:

/manage/emailpost.bml.help.to|notes=The "email" variable will be replaced with the .help.exampleusername string + @post.livejournal.com OR .help.exampleusername + .help.pin + @post.livejournal.com (unless the user is logged in and/or has specified a PIN, in which case it uses the user's actual username and/or PIN).

/support/encodings.bml.edit.header=I cannot edit my entries in the web interface!

/support/encodings.bml.edit.text2<<
<?p <b>Short answer:</b> <i>(applicable if you write your journal in English)</i>: Go to your 
<a [[aopts1]]>personal settings page</a>. Find an option near the bottom of the page that is
called <b>Auto-convert older entries from:</b>. Choose "Western European (Windows)" from the
pull-down menu and save your settings. Your entries should now be editable. p?>

<?p <b>Long answer</b>: In order to allow you to edit a non-Unicode entry, LiveJournal code needs to 
know which encoding that entry has been posted in. For users of English and other West European 
languages, this will normally be "Western European (Windows)", although if that doesn't work well
for quote characters and other similar meta-characters, try "Western European (ISO)". Users
writing in other languages should select their encoding; if it isn't in the supplied list, 
contact <a [[aopts2]]>Support</a> and explain the problem.  p?>

<?p Note that "non-Unicode entry" may mean either a journal entry posted before LiveJournal underwent
the conversion to Unicode, or a new journal entry posted recently with a client program that 
is not Unicode-compatible.  p?>
.

/support/encodings.bml.editcl.header=I cannot edit my entries in the client program!

/support/encodings.bml.editcl.text<<
<?p If there is a newer version of your client program that supports Unicode,
upgrade. If not, you will be able to edit entries which contain ASCII symbols only (basically
the Latin alphabet and the usual punctuation signs). For entries any fancy symbols or other 
languages you will have to resort to editing via the web interface, which works fine in any case. p?>
.

/support/encodings.bml.groups.header=I cannot edit my friend lists with my client program!

/support/encodings.bml.groups.text2<<
<?p This is probably due to you having friend groups with names that aren't exclusively ASCII (for
example, written in non-Latin languages or containing accent symbols). In order to successfully
work with such group names, you have to use a Unicode-supporting client. Alternatively, you
can rename your groups to ASCII-only names on the 
<a [[aopts]]>group editing page</a> and then use your client program. p?>
.

/support/encodings.bml.overview.header=What is this all about?

/support/encodings.bml.overview.text<<
<?p LiveJournal uses Unicode to store and display everything: 
text of journal entries, comments, names and personal information... everything. 
Unicode is a very powerful standard for working with text. 
For example, it allows users to store and input information in many languages at once. 
It supports the infrastructure of translating and maintaining the user interface in 
languages other than English. p?>

<?p Journal entries and comments which had been stored before LiveJournal switched
to Unicode need to be converted to Unicode on-the-fly in order for the user to be able 
to view or edit them. This page explains how to deal with some of the common problems in
that area. p?>
