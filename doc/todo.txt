    This is just my (bradfitz) own todo list.  It may not make much
    sense but at this point it's not supposed to.  It's just notes to
    myself about what needs to be done.  (and it now has stuff for
    dormando too)

+----------+
| Dormando |
+----------+

* Netsaint on mayor.
* Write new netsaint modules (warning if slaves are too far behind, 
  using an updated db_check script, etc.)

+----------------+
| Awaiting merge |
+----------------+

* option to strip target= on <a> on friends pages (halkeye)
* goatctl, cvsreport --init
* deprecate /cgi-bin/log.cgi, make /interface?mode=<...>

+------+
| Todo |
+------+

* rewrite the account expiration logic
* "unpay" console command
* postevent dup locking
* rate limiting (bradfitz)
* journal titles vs. names:
    http://www.livejournal.com/talkread.bml?itemid=14018511
* need a community admin page where the primary community
  admin can give/remove 'sharedjournal' privs to secondary admins
* RELEASE!  new tarball.
  * [X] add "scope enum('general','local')" to all prop tables
    -- change SQL exporter to recognize only general
  * decide location/formats of compiled documentation
  * write/revise release script (which must build docs too)
* fix LJ::get_itemid_{before|after} to respect security of $remote
* add hooks to verify people aren't faking their paid user cookie
* htdocs/userpic: why use LJ::Cache at all if we're using disk now?
* htdocs/userpic: doesn't clean disk cache yet
* /fz/ joins on logtext (requires master) 
* talk* joins on logtext (requires master)
* cvsreport:
   * -c doesn't need to scan maind.. perf.
   * -s with args doesn't need to scan everything, just args.
* ljcom: automate username changes (payments and renaming)
* support: dakus wants to be able to mark requests as "still needs help"
* LJ::delete_user()
* require POST for all do actions (use LJ::did_post to check)
* add bmlp.pl config option to disable BMLSESSION stuff, since we don't
  use it anyway
* editjournal_do: clean HTML (marquees don't close, etc.)
* directory: (need to set non-pub userprops on editinfo change)
* talklib.pl finishing (avva?)
* store as UTF-8 in database (avva investigating)
* ehtml current mood/music ?
* bug: multiple talkread delete: /support/see_request.bml?id=10159
* perf: don't preload friends in ljprotocol.pl:editfriends, check $sth->rows

+-------------+
| Cleanliness |
+-------------+

* should never need to login as community!
  -- e.g. uploadpic/editinfo/etc needs to let community admins 
          select their community to modify while logged in as
          themselves
* use LJ::send_mail everywhere, not by hand
* XHTML compliant everywhere
* remove *_do.bml pages, merge with main page instead.

+----------------+

+----------------+

+--------+
| Future |
+--------+

* HTML email we send out with images should be the images in the MIME body
  and then HTML part reference those, not the ones on the site
* attach files to posts (good for groupware)
  -- new cap limits:  canattachfile, filemaxsize (0 for no limit)
* support system tweaks:
   - ugly green to blue
   - allow touching by helpers
   - allow 5 minute locks
   - allow full email address to be shown to helpers
* log merging 
* use <label> and accesskey= everywhere, for accessibility and
  people that hate the mouse.
* ability to further resrict HTML in comments in your journal:
  no marquee, no img, etc.
* respect user.status=="L" --> never let be modified, deleted, purged, etc

+--------------+
| low priority |
+--------------+

* ability to turn off display of friend ofs / friends / community ofs
* remove necessity of menu_num arg in populate_web_menu 
* allowing @livejournal.com on create_do.bml, but not editinfo_do.bml
* on friends page, altposter posts show community mood theme, not owner's
* remove directories in BML... make just generic.look -> scheme.look
