Debian packages required to build documentation:

   xsltproc
   docbook-xml

Useful package to edit XML in emacs, but not required:

   nxml-mode

The build/generate.pl script will auto-download the recommended XSL if you
have a network connection and livejournal.org is alive, but you can
also use:

   docbook-xsl

However, the DocBook XSL stylesheets are in a lot of flux, so using
the ones we develop and test with (currently version 1.71.0) is recommended.

To build:

$ $LJHOME/doc/raw/build/generate.pl

The docs will show up at:

   http://your.lj.server/doc/server/
