                 ***** ADVERTISING LEXICON *****

There are a number of voodoo words and concepts in LJ::ads() and the
related advertising code.  This document aims to demystify them.  This
document might be inaccurate.  If so, please fix it.

>>> type, aka "ctx".

   LJ::ads(type => $type)
   ...
   LJ::run_hook("should_show_ad", { ctx => $type });

   A type/context is either "app" or "journal".

>> orient

   stuff like "BML-App-Confirm".  this uniquely identifies a place in
   the code where an ad can go (and be turned on/off).

>> pagetype

   same as orient, without leading "BML-", if present.

>> "AD_PAGE_MAPPING", mapping.

   How to behave for a given orient/pagetype(?), basically a hashref of:
      {
         adunit => "skyscraper",  # leaderboard, etc.
         target => "user",        # content, etc
      }

>> "%AD_TYPE", aka "adunit"

    skyscraper => { width => 160, height => 600 }

>> position

   LJ::ads(position => $pos)
