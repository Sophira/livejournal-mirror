The 'caps' column in the 'user' table is a 16 bit mask with a bit on
for each capability class the user is a part of.  Each site can define
their own capability classes in cgi-bin/ljconfig.pl.  Then, each
capability class can define its own limits for the following things.
The LJ::get_cap()/get_cap_min() functions will consider the limits of
all the classes the member is a part of and return the max or min
limit, depending on what it's being used for in the code.
