ESN (Event/Subscription/Notification) works like this:

-- lots of things on the site fire events.  An event is defined
   by the tuple:

       (journalid,eventtype,e_arg1,e_arg2)

   Where journalid is the primary journal it took place in.  (the
   journal a new post is in, or the journal a comment is in)  In
   some cases, it makes less sense, for example a befriending:
   just pick which of the two-journal(user) relationship is
   more important, and make that the journalid for that event type.

   e_arg1 and e_arg2 are eventtype-defined integers.  But that's
   all you have to completely describe the event that took place.
   Given that it's not much space, most eventtypes will use one
   or both fields to point to another database record that fully
   describe the event.  e.g, e_arg1 being the primary key
   of a new journal event or journal comment.

-- people then subscribe to events, subject to privacy/stalking rules.
   just because an event fires, doesn't mean it's subscribable.
   a subscription has its own arg1/arg2, but those s_arg1/s_arg2 have
   nothing to do with the e_arg1/e_arg2.
